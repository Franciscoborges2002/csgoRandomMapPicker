# csgoRandomMapPicker

When i got bored with my friends we diceded to play some CS:GO to distract ourselves. So sometimes during the summer at night we used to play a lot and repeating some maps over and over again.
So i created this simple csgo random map picker to variate the csgo map that we were going to play.

You can download and use it if you want. And if you want to change the maps that you want to play just go to main.js and on the maps variable put the names that you want :)
